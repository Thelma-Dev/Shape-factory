## Shape-Factory

A fun activity that lets you create a stack of circles and rectangles using your preferred colour.

When the create button is clicked, a new div element is created, styled and appended to the storage. The storage can hold only 15 shapes.

A click on each shape displays the name of the shape and its color in the message box.
